What makes both similar to me are the tasks you have to follow based on the direction you have in your manual. Logically, they are on the same path. You have to develop a perfect mind-body relationship to follow the tasks. In performing the whole body must be in active communication with the brain, but in coding & developing, the hands mostly are activley involved with brain activity.
